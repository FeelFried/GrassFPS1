# Grass FPS Enhancer

Synthesis patcher that improves your framerate by optimizing grass *(`GRAS`)* records in the same way as mods like **Grass FPS Booster** &amp; **Grass on Steroids**. The advantage of using Synthesis is that you don't have to worry about patches, since the resulting plugin is tailored to your specific load order.  

Now you can mix & match grass mods without worrying about optimization patches!

Like many of my other patchers, this uses categories & filters to apply values to specific records.  
This allows you to build your own dynamic grass mod without any programming experience.
